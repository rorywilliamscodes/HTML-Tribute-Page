This is a tribute webpage dedicated to Nicholas Winton, a remarkable British humanitarian known for his heroic efforts during the Holocaust. The webpage features a main section with an ID of "main" that contains various elements.

The webpage begins with a title, "Nicholas Winton," displayed prominently at the top. Below the title, there is an image section represented by a div with an ID of "img-div." Inside this div, there is an image element with an ID of "image" that displays a photograph of Nicholas Winton. The image is centered within its parent element and is responsive, adjusting its size according to the width of the container while maintaining its original proportions. A caption describing the image is provided within a figcaption element with an ID of "img-caption."

Following the image section, there is a section with an ID of "tribute-info" that provides a textual description of Nicholas Winton's remarkable achievements.
