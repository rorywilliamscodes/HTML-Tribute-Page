            <p>Nicholas Winton was a British humanitarian who organized the rescue of 669 children, most of them Jewish, from Czechoslovakia during the Holocaust in 1939.</p>
            <p>His efforts went unrecognized for decades until his wife found a scrapbook in their attic containing records of the children he had saved.</p>
            <p>Winton's story serves as a testament to the power of one person's compassion and determination to make a difference in the world.</p>
